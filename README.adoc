== Q&A

[qanda]
Where is the code documentation?:: Coming soon, after text chat is working.
What is the test coverage of this project?:: Coming soon (probably never :joy:)
Can I contribute to this?:: No.
Can I support this?::
    No, due to IRL job reasons I can't accept donations.
Can I use this for my own project?::
    Yes, I only ask that you: +
	a) don't imply I endorse your stuff, +
	b) know I provide no warranties for this code, +
	c) won't use this as a trojan wrapper for your shitty rootkit / bitcoinminer.
